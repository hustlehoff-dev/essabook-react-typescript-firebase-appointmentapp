# EssaBook – Web Appointment Management App

EssaBook is a lightweight, web-based application designed for service business owners (e.g., barbers) who want to manage client appointments easily – mobile-first, intuitive, and chaos-free.

The original project started as a mobile app:  
➡️ [reactnative-firebase-appointment-app](https://github.com/hustlehoff-dev/reactnative-firebase-appointment-app)  
During testing, the decision was made to rebuild it entirely as a web application.

## 🟢 Current Project State (as of: 25.04.2025)

The app is fully functional and currently in **commercial testing** with 3 business users.

### ✅ What works:

- Users can **book and cancel appointments**.
- The main screen shows a **daily agenda** with the upcoming appointment and the **most recent past visit** (rebooking with 1 click – currently being implemented).
- After booking, the client receives an **SMS notification**.
- At **18:00 (6 PM) the day before** the appointment, the client gets an **SMS reminder with links to confirm or cancel** (1-click – done).
- Appointment status updates **in real-time** (booked → confirmed/cancelled).

### 🔧 In progress:

- **Client blacklist** (for no-shows and frequent cancellers).
- **Contacts module** (manage clients).
- **Appointment widget redesign** (more like a planner than a simple list).
- **Clickable dates** in the agenda to quickly browse days.
